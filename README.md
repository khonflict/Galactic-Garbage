# Unsolved Problems
**Images**

I was not able to pass images onto the variables as hoped.

**Additional Levels**

The inital plan was to create 5 levels with increasing difficulty and different types of garbage. Since I was only able to develop one level I increased the numbers of bebris to make it more challenging.
